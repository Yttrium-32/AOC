# Advent of code

This repository contains the solutions that I've come up with for advent of
code, written in python.

## Usage
Each year contains code organised by day and problem part.
The `main.py` file contains the actual code, while `test.txt` is the example
input and `in.txt` is actual input.
To use simply run:
```
$ python main.py < test.txt
```
or
```
$ python main.py < in.txt
```
